<b>Ebay shopping website.<b>
I made many efforts to make a shopping website that can help future Business enthusiasts to use it.
Added many features like chat,application forms for feedback about the company as well as for signing up.
The website contains 4 different pages, you will land up to each through different anchor tags hitting.
1.landing page.
2.If you click chat, attached is a fully responsive customer service representative profile opens up.So that the customer will know to whom he or she is interacting and what is their technical expertise which make sure that
Customers are in good hand.In this page I used pulse animation effects as well grid layout to display Customer representative education background and expertise.
This page is fully responsive as created using grid and media queries.
3.If you click the Return button on the navigation bar on top of the home page,attached you will find a page which will show that the site you are trying to ping is down ,try again.
Try again will take you back to the home page.
I used the animation effect to create a wait time circle on that page,which will show a circle is moving in clockwise direction that displays customers a message that the website is i
trying to dwolaod.Thus , customers can have patience to wait for those 2s while site downloads.
4..In the footer of the webpage, you will find a tab"feedback",if the user presses it ,it will take the user to
feedback form page to give his valuable feedback or to ask questions,comments or concerns.
5.On the Home page created an animation in which block moves from left to right and display a message
"We are Hiring now!Click here to apply for jobs! "If user press that it will take user to JOb application form where i used select button to give user multiple choices to select for the Developer jobs they are
interested in applying.This page is fully responsive if the user selects different screen sizes, the divs stack over each other to give the user full freedom to see the page without any issues in any screen size..
Thus I completed the SBA Project with all my efforts ,I tried to include everything as instructed for SBA assignment.

a.On Home page,I created a select button on navbar which selects "all" items.
b.Multiple choice drop down menu on Job Application form.To access it, hit the animation on the main page which says-"We are hiring now.."
4.Used 10 different HTMl tags,included media queries,animation effects,flex box,absolute position for divs, different icons, gifs,,text images,GIfs,

5.Used inline, internal, and external styling.,comments.
Please note-I prefer using external style sheets for styling but to demonstrate an example of "internal styling."

To demonstrate an example for "inline styling"
Path==>.
Go to folder name User_registration_form

6.Use five different CSS select.

Ques: What was your motivation?
My motivation is to create a fully functioning shopping website for close friends who want to start a new product business.

Ques Why did you build this project?
I created a fully functional shopping website in which I added a new feature which I believe is missing in todays' shopping websites .I believe it gives alot of peace when
the customer knows representative information about whom they are dealing with. I believe we should have a choice to select whom we want to choose to help resolve our technical glitch Product enquiry issues.
where customers can see aService representative profile before getting connected to them.They see the profile

Ques What problem does it solve?
Many times we come across people who don't have enough knowledge to resolve our technical issues and thus time gets wasted.
By giving customers a freedom to choose the right representative saves time,energy and efficiency.

Ques: What did you learn?
I learned a lot of things while doing animation effects and media queries.
I wish had some more time,
I would like to add some more customer representative profiles to my site.
Some responsive Products details page when someone clicks to see more about a project.

Thank you!
